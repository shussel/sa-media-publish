# sa-media-publish

SA Media Publish is a plugin to stage and manage the publication of image resources on a Wordpress website. I created this plugin for use on my personal travel blog at ShanesAdventure.com.

# Features

* Media Library screen customization to indicate publication status, licensing info and allow publication of images with custom sorting
* Custom data fields to track image shooting date, auto publish date, timezone for localization of image metadata, and additional info for image licensing
* Ability to auto pubish images on a specific date with daily cron function
* Enhancement of available image metadata with utiity display functions
* Custom attachment permalinks with attachment pages added to wp_sitemap for SEO
* Inserts structured image data on attachment pages for additional SEO
